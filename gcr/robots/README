                  Programming-language-agnostic robot battles

This framework is where people can write robots in their own programming
language - whichever one they wish - and they'll be run and connected with a
central server.

Ideas borrowed from AT Robots 2, http://necrobones.com/atrobots/ and see the
specification here: http://necrobones.com/pub/atrobots/docs/atr2.txt

This framework runs in three parts:
    1. A server that hosts the battles
    2. A client API that connects to the server and runs the programs
    3. A web page of some sort so a human can see the field and watch their
       robots perform

URL reference:
    http://host/matches                 Redirects the user to the list of
                                        matches if in a browser
    http://host/matches?history=t       Tracks the history of the match list
                                        (for long polling clients)
    http://host/matches?list=t          JSON object of current list of matches.
    http://host/matches?register=t      Registers a match. Returns the ID of the
                                        match along with a code so you can start
                                        it.
    http://host/matches/00000           Web page of certain match.
    http://host/matches/00000?register=t Register a slot in a match.
    http://host/matches/000/slot?connect=t Connect to a running match.
    http://host/matches/000?start=t&code=c Start a match.

Basic outline of a match:
- The person writes a robot in their progamming language of choice.
- The robot, when ready, connects to a unique match URL on the server. This is
    probably a unique, temporary URL with a special query parameter that only
    that instance of the robot and the server should know. Probably something
    like http://robotwars.com/matches/12358912/robot_982349721347
    The URL should should disappear after the match is over. This method should
    easily do two things:

    - Allow the user to intervene if they wish. (e.g. the web page shows a
      button that says "Here is your unique URL, paste this into your code"
      and then they'll do just that and their robot will connect. This is useful
      if the user just wants to test out one simple robot without registering it
      against their account.

    - Or, allow the robot to do this in an automated fashion, for e.g.
      tournaments and such. The user could assign a unique ID to their robot in
      their source code, register that ID to their account, and then stick the
      robot in tournaments or whatever. It would then connect to the match. If
      it should go to a match right away; e.g. if another person "challenged"
      the robot or if it's in a tournament, the server will report its "match
      URL" and the client robot will connect. If not, it could tell the server
      that it wants to fight and go on a "challenge list" or something.

      Here's an example. A simple client where the user doesn't mind copying and
      pasting the URL from the web page before every match could look like this:

          url = raw_input("Copy+paste the URL on the web page: ")

          robot = RoboLink.connect(url)
          if robot is none:
            sys.exit("Connection failed.")

          while not robot.dead():
            robot.shoot()


      A persistent client would look more like this:

          ID = md5sum("StormBot " + VERSION + external_ip)
          while True:
              if RoboLink.registered(ID):
                  matches = RoboLink.get_pending_matches(ID)
              else:
                  matches = [raw_input("Copy+paste the URL on the web page: ")]

              for match in matches:
                  robot = RoboLink.connect(match)
                  if robot is none:
                    sys.exit("Connection failed.")

                  while not robot.dead():
                    robot.shoot()
                  if robot.is_winner():
                    print "We won! Awright!"

      Of course, the API could probably abstract this quite a bit into something
      like:

          def run_robot(robot):
              while not robot.dead():
                robot.shoot
          ID = md5sum("StormBot " + VERSION + external_ip)
          RoboLink.persistent_connection(ID, run_robot)

      which could prompt the user for a key or just run indefinitely.

      This allows users to have long-standing "client robot daemons" on their
      computer, just waiting for a fight and connecting immediately when there
      is one.

- The robot could optionally declare attributes about itself when it connects;
  say, something like this:

        robot.connect_with_type({'speed': 25,
                        'armor': 30,
                        'power': 90})

        The robot.signal_ready() call blocks until ALL opponents call it.

- Then the match begins. Robots could do stuff like

    targets = robot.scan()
    for bearing, position in targets:
       print "Robot detected at %d degrees %m away" % (bearing, position)

    In this example, robot.scan() would block for a bit -- scanning takes time
    of course! -- and then prints all the robots that it found to the console.

- When all but one robot is dead, they could call stuff like robot.dead() to
  find out if they're dead and robot.is_winner() to see if they are the winner,
  etc.
